Put your message into the Encoder folder as a text file with the name "message" and double click the python program and a text file named "finishedmessage" will appear.
That is the coded message.
To use the decoder, place the "finishedmessage" text file (or make one and copy paste the coded message into it) into the Decoder folder.
Double click on the python program and the decoded message will appear as a text file named "decodedmessage"
Do not use any capital letters, returns, or punctuation.
The decoder will not work (properly) if it does not have the same key the message was encoded with.
If someone is trying to access the key without authoritization, delete it, I can provide it again, or make a new one.
Make sure you have the latest Python version.
